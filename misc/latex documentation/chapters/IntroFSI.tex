\chapter{Fluid-Structure Interaction}
\label{chapter:Fluid-Structure Interaction}
	This chapter aims to provide an overview of the \emph{Fluid-Structure Interaction} (FSI) segment of this work. The first two sections brief the \emph{theoretical} (\refSection{sec:Theoretical Background}) and \emph{modelling} (\refSection{sec:Modelling}) aspects of FSI, used within this work, such as the \emph{multi-physics} aspect of FSI, mathematical description of fluids and structures, as well as the approaches used for solving an FSI problem. The last two sections are destined to overview the employed \emph{FSI codes}, i.e. the multi-physics package \emph{Alya} and the coupling library \emph{preCICE}.
